# Can we define the best-performing overseas player from the 2020 Indian Premier League season?
The Indian Premier League, or IPL, is cricket's biggest Twenty20 cricket league, both in terms of viewership and lucrativity. The 8 franchise teams, each centered around a major Indian city, are allowed to have no more than 4 overseas (non - Indian) players in their team for each match. As a result, as the competition goes on, franchises will experiment with their playing squad to find their best team.
